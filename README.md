*Malarai-Detection*


*Description*

Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection. Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.
Key facts
Globally in 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608 000 malaria deaths in 85 countries.
The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden.
In 2022, the Region was home to 94% of malaria cases (233 million) and 95% (580 000) of malaria deaths.
Children under 5 accounted for about 80% of all malaria deaths in the Region.
Overview
Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficult breathing.Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection. Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.There are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi.
Symptoms
The most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.
Symptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.
Symptoms may be mild for some people, especially for those who have had a malaria infection before. Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important. 
Some types of malaria can cause severe illness and death. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk. Severe symptoms include:
extreme tiredness and fatigue 
impaired consciousness
multiple convulsions
difficulty breathing
dark or bloody urine
jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin) 
abnormal bleeding.

Study Area and Design
Sample Size Determination
The sample size for the study was estimated by using the Haijan-Tilaki method [8] applying the sensitivity of diagnostic tools as follows:
NSE=[Z2×SE(1−SE)d2×P],
(1)where Z = 1.96 at 95% confidence level, SE (sensitivity of standard diagnostic tool) = 0.97, d2 (margin of error) = 0.05, and P (prevalence) = 0.86. The sensitivity of standard diagnostic tools was 97% according to a previous study [9]. The estimated prevalence in the eastern region of Nepal from the previous study was 0.86 [10]. Applying a 95% confidence level value of Z = 1.96 and precision or margin of error d = 5%. The estimated sample size was calculated as 52.
Sample Collection, Processing, and Storage
Malaria Detection from Blood Films using Light Microscopy
Quantification of Malaria Parasites by the Red Blood Cell (RBC)
Count Method using Thin Smear
Parasite quantification was performed using the RBC count method following the WHO protocol [12] using the formula:
Estimation of parasitemia  (μL)=number of parasitized RBC(in20fields)×50000000total number of RBC count.
(2)The percentage of parasitemia was calculated by counting the infected RBC per 2000 RBCs using the formula:
percentage of parasitemia=number of Parasitized RBC×100%total number of RBC count.

Malaria Detection using a Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)
The histidine-rich protein-2 and Plasmodium-specific lactase dehydrogenase–based rapid diagnostic test kit by Malascan™ (lot number 51091) was used [WHO panel detection score: 97% sensitivity for Plasmodium falciparum and 90% for Plasmodium species other than Plasmodium falciparum (PAN) between 2000 and 5000 parasites/μL of the whole blood sample and 82.8% (Pf) and 57.1% (PAN) for 200 parasites/μL of the blood sample with false positivity of 1% for PAN and 0.7% for Pf]. The tests were performed using rapid diagnostic kits, following the manufacturer's instructions [13].
DNA Extraction of Blood Samples using Qiagen Kits
Blood samples, preserved in 0.5 mg EDTA vials, were stored at −70°C to prevent DNA degradation. Samples were left at room temperature for 30 minutes before the extraction process was carried out. 
Taqman Assay-Based Real-Time PCR for Amplification of Different Plasmodium Species Extracted DNA was amplified using a Qiagen Rotor-Gene Q system using abTes™ Malaria 5 qPCR commercially available kit (catalog number 300229) using a set of specific primers for each Plasmodium species designed by the manufacturer. Firstly, a master mix solution was prepared using the following scheme: primer/probe: 2 μL, enzyme/reaction mix: 6 μL, nuclease-free water: 12 μL, and template: 5 μL. The thermal cycler was programmed as phase 1 at 95°C for 2 min to implement one cycle, phase 2 at 60°C for 20 seconds to produce 30 cycles, and phase 3 at 68°C for 1 minute per kb to generate 30 cycles on the basis of manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence intensity was measured using the Rotor gene Q software, and the graph of fluorescence intensity vs. the number of cycles was plotted [15].
Real-time PCR-based TaqMan assay was performed to identify the species and compare the results with microscopy and the RDT. Plasmodium DNA was amplified. Five fluorescent dyes, i.e., FAM, HEX, ROX, Cy5, and Quasar 705, were used to detect five different species of Plasmodium [15],
  FAM (green)-Plasmodium falciparum,
  Cy5 (red)-Plasmodium ovale
  HEX (yellow)-Plasmodium malariae,
  ROX (orange)-Plasmodium vivax
  Quasar 705(crimson)-Plasmodium knowlesi
where positive control = all malaria-positive control available in the commercial kit and negative control = phosphate buffer saline.
Blood samples were considered positive for malaria based on fluorescence intensities which were greater than the threshold or cutoff values.
Data Management and Statistical Analysis
The collected data were entered into an excel spreadsheet, coding was done for different variables, and the data was transferred to SPSS version 11.5. The comparison between different diagnostic tools was done using real-time PCR as the gold standard assay. Applying the chi-square test by constructing 2 × 2 table, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the diagnostic tests were calculated. The level of agreement between microscopy and the RDT were estimated by using the interrelated kappa coefficient, and p values were calculated by using the chi-square test by using SPSS
